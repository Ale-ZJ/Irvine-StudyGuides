# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is concerned with **rational action.** We say that an **intelligent agent** takes the best action in a situation.&#x20;

* Philosophers suggests that the mind is like a machine that operated on knowledge encoded in some internal language and that thought is used to choose what actions to take
* Mathematicians provided logical and probabilistic tools to manipulate statements, and set the core ideas of algorithms
* Economist finalized that the decision making should be used to maximize the expected utility of the decision maker
* Computer Engineers provided more powerful machines to make AI applications possible
* Control theory designed devices that acts based on feedback&#x20;

Artificial Intelligence is the science of _agent_ design. An **agent** is something that acts in an environment.

* The **agent function** specifies the action taken by the agent in response to any sequence
* The behaviour of the agent in an environment can be quantified with a **performance measure**
* A **rational agent** maximizes the expected value of the performance measure
* There are different types of agents&#x20;
  * **simple reflex agent** respond directly to percepts
  * **model based reflex agents** mantain internal state to track information that is not evident in the current percept
  * **goal based agent** act to achieve a goal
  * **utility based agents** act to maximize their own expected "hapiness"
* All agents can improve their performance by learning&#x20;
