## Containers

The C++ Standard Library provides a set of what are called containers \(or data structures\), some examples of which include:

* **std::vector**, an array-based sequence, in the same spirit as the ArrayList class we wrote in a previous example
* **std::list**, a doubly-linked list with head and tail pointers
* **std::map**, a balanced binary search tree of key/value pairs
