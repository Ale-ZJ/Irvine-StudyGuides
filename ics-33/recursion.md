# Recursion

## Proof Rules

1. Base case 
2. Smaller input 
3. Combine everything while assuming all recursion works

## Divide and Conquer

* BASE CASE
  * smallest thing you can plug in 
    * a lil brute force
    * often element = 1 or empty
* DIVIEDE - SMALLER INPUT
  * number decreased somhow 
    * slicing, splitting 
  * leave behind the first element of a list \(inefficient but always works\)
  * sorting \(n/2\) \(efficient but not always work\)
    * divide in halves
      * takes one element as pivot
* MERGE AND CONQUER
  * assume recursive function works 
  * how to combine things together 
  * **ONE LEVEL APPROACH - do not think about all the layers**
    * non trivial instance of a problem
    * compute what your final answer should be \(no code\)
    * make your split and apply recursive functions appropriately
    *
